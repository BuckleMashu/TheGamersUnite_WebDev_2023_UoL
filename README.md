# TheGamersUniteWebsite_WebDev_2023_UoL
This repository contains "The Gamers Unite", a personal blog website and my first coding project, made approximately five months into my Computer Science studies at the University of London with minimal prior coding experience. The project was a journey of learning core web development fundamentals, particularly in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Key learning breakthroughs included mastering JavaScript-driven slideshows and interactive content display, understanding advanced CSS hover effects for smoother UI, and grasping basic accessibility and usability principles. While proud of the outcome as a foundational effort, there are areas for future improvement in deeper accessibility implementation and overall code logic (There is a page filled with repeating html section because I dont know how to apply for-loop for html content at that point).

The website serves as a digital scrapbook and blog, chronicling the experiences, hangouts, and memories of a close-knit group of friends formed in 2015. The design and content aim to convey the fun, sometimes chaotic, and close nature of the group.
