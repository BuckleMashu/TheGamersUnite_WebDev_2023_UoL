        <p class="aboutUsDescription">Welcome to our website, dedicated to a group of close friends that was formed in Bedok Green Secondary School 2015. Our bonds is built on trust, laughter, gaslighting, and borderline harrassment toward each others. Whether we are exploring new places, trying out a new restaurant, or simply living our busy daily lives, we always make enjoy one another's companies. Thus, with how much memories we formed for years, we decided to make this website to share others about our hangouts and act as an archive memory book for ourselves. We hope that our website will give you a glimpse into this "special friendship" that we have and the questionable things we did together.</p>
