    <p class="Opening">It was 2pm, the Gamer Unite gathered at the Bedok Mall to buy ingredients for the two dishes we are going cook together. Garlic, onions, basils, potatoes are some of the ingredients we bought. As we were walking toward the bus stop opposite the Bedok mall to catch a bus, laughter can be heard.  We were catching up on each other's lives, sharing hilarious things we found and did. But suddenly, right before we reach the bus stop...our stomache grumbled. We decided to eat McDonald for lunch first.</p>

            <p class="cookingStepTitle">Preparation</p>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>bring the Fusilli pasta, 2 teaspoons of salt, and 1 tablespoon of olive oil into a pot of boiling water. Cook the pasta until it is al dente as it will continue to cook in the pan later. The recommended cooking time is 10 - 15 minutes, afterward, drain them. Do remember to save some pasta water for the sauce later.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Process the vegetables. Wash them, chop the basil into thin strip, dice the onion, and slice the garlic thinly.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil, chopped garlic and onion to a medium temperature pan. Becareful of the temperature as we dont want the garlic to burn too much</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>After the onion turn translucent, add the cherry tomatoes and 4 tablespoons of saved pasta water into the pan. Then close the lidfor 3 minutes, as we want to the tomatoes to soften quickly</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>Smash the cherry tomatoes, add the 2 tablespoons of tomato paste, and stir for 1 minutes on medium high heat. This is so to give the sauce a slight pleasent burn flavour</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <p>Lower the heat back to medium and add the pasta and basil. Stir for 2 minutes, cover and turn off the heat to allow the residual heat to finish the cooking</p>
            <p class="finalstep">You can add any additional salt, sugar, pepper,or dried herb at Step 5 or 6 to your taste.</p>

            <p>One day, we were sitting around trying to figure out what to do for the evening. We wanted to hang out, but we were all tired of the usual routine of going out to eat or grabbing drinks at a bar. That's when thanks to Mr. Foo Jun “Omakase Chef” Peng and Mr. Adip “Head Chef” Herman, they have blessed us with knowing what to cook for our meet-up and we all loved the idea. After arriving at Jun Peng’s house, we decide to relax in his room and entertain ourselves. Talking about how I found a mini Quran keychain on Shoppee and immediately bought it, what are the plans for our modded Minecraft server, changing Jun Peng’s desktop background picture, playing chess, etc. Just doing things that are of our interest.<br><br><br><br>Cooking is a great way to bring people together. There's something about sharing a meal that makes us feel connected and happy (definitely not us messing around). What I love about cooking together is that it's a team effort. Everyone has a role to play, whether it's chopping vegetables, stirring a pot, or setting the table. It's a great way to bond . We talked about how to process certain ingredients to our next major travel plans. It's amazing how much we enjoy one another's company when we're all in the kitchen together.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="secondRow">
            <p>Through out our cooking process, we joked around, A LOT. Things we did can ranges from juggling potatoes, capitalising one's mistake, to Adip calling others sous chefs.<br><br><br><br>In conclusion, cooking dinner together has become a highlight of my week. It's amazing to see how much we've grown as friends by simply spending time in the kitchen. Cooking together has taught us teamwork(maybe), patience(possibly), and the value of good food(100% &#x1F525). I believe that sharing a meal with friends is one of life's greatest pleasures, and cooking it together is even better. So, if you're looking for a fun and rewarding way to bond with your friends, I highly recommend giving cooking together a try. You won't regret it!</p>
