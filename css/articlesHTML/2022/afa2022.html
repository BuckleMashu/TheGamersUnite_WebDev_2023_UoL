  <p class="Opening">Anime Festival Asia (AFA) is a series of anime conventions and festivals that celebrate Japanese popular culture in Southeast Asia. The first AFA event was held in Singapore in 2008, and since then it has expanded to other countries in the region, including Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia.</p>
  <div class="crowdedAFA">
    <p>At AFA events, attendees can expect to see a variety of activities and attractions related to anime, manga, video games, and other aspects of Japanese popular culture. These can include anime screenings, cosplay competitions, musical performances by Japanese artists, merchandise booths, and appearances by popular anime voice actors and creators.<br><br>
      In addition to these activities, AFA events also provide a platform for companies in the anime and Japanese pop culture industry to showcase and promote their latest products and projects to a wide audience. This makes AFA a popular destination for fans and industry professionals alike, and has helped to establish it as one of the leading anime conventions in Southeast Asia.</p>

  <div class="interestingCosplay">
    <p>And as seen above, Jun Peng and I cosplayed Anya and Loid from the hit anime show, Spy x Family. Additionally, to make our first time cosplaying experience much smoother, our mutual friend (Syakira) also join us by cosplaying Yor on the 25th November.<br><br>
      We spent the first few hours browsing through the various merchandise booths, picking up some new manga volumes and checking out the latest anime figures. There were so many different items to choose from as there were booths hosted by well-known artists, voice actors, and cosplayers. Since the whole festival is in a hall, we can listen and spectate all of the on-going performances on the central stage. Suprisingly, we met our mutual friend, Jonaton Joms, at the event on both of our visit on the 25th and 27th as well. We meet many other interesting cosplayers during our time at the event and these are my personal favorite.</p>

  <div class="ending">
    <p>As the day drew to a close, famous Virtual celebrities such as Korone from Holo-Live were able to make an appearance on the stage. I was thrilled to see so many talented individuals in action. It was the perfect way to end a day filled with all things anime and Japanese pop culture.<br><br>
      Overall, Anime Festival Asia was an amazing experience, and I can't wait to attend again next year.
