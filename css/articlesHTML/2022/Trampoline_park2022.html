        <p>Bounce Singapore offers a variety of activities and games, such as free-jumping, basketball dunking, dodgeball, and a ninja obstacle course. The park also offers fitness classes and programs, such as Bounce Fit, which is a high-intensity cardio workout that incorporates trampoline exercises.<br><br>
          In addition to the trampolines and activities, Bounce Singapore has a variety of other amenities, such as a café, party rooms, and a chill-out area. The park is a popular destination for birthday parties, corporate events, and team-building activities.<br><br>
          Thus, we felt that it will be a suitable place for us to have a great time.

      <div class="NinjaCourse">
        <p>Even though Bounce Singapore Trampoline Park is well known for its…well… Trampolines, we actually found the Ninja obstacle course to be more interesting as we test our speed and dexterity to complete the course.<br><br>
          There are ziplines, monkey bars, bouldering, parallel wall climbing, etc. at  Bounce Singapore’s ninja course. Those courses are familiar to the  American Ninja but easier. Bounce even have the iconic (but budget)  Warped Wall and Quintuple Steps. And honestly, they were tiring! I will have to make up a gym routine to get in shape.

        <p>One of the highlights of our day was playing dodgeball on the trampolines. We split into teams and bounced around, dodging and catching the ball in mid-air. It was an intense workout that had us all laughing and cheering.<br><br>
          As the day went on, we started to feel the burn in our muscles from all the jumping and bouncing. We took a break at the café, refueling with some snacks and drinks before getting back to the action.

      <div class="Conclusion">
        <p>Overall, our visit to Bounce Singapore was an awesome experience. We had a great time trying out all the different activities and games, and we left feeling energized and happy. We would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and unique way to spend a day with friends and family."</p>
