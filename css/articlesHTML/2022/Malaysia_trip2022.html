        <p class="Opening">Kuala Lumpur (KL), the capital city of Malaysia, is located in the west-central part of the country, and it is the largest city in Malaysia with a population of over 7 million people in the greater metropolitan area.<br><br></p>

            <p>Kuala Lumpur is a bustling and vibrant city, known for its skyscrapers, shopping districts, and cultural landmarks. Some of the notable attractions in Kuala Lumpur include the Petronas Twin Towers, the Batu Caves, the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia, and the Merdeka Square. The city is also home to a diverse range of restaurants and street food vendors, serving up a variety of traditional Malay, Chinese, and Indian dishes.<br><br>
                As the capital city of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur is also an important center for business, commerce, and finance. Many multinational corporations have their offices and headquarters in the city, and it is also home to several international conferences and exhibitions.

            <p>Considering that we have a close friend group in KL and we are about to enter university, it is a perfect way for the Gamer Unite to end a major chapter of our life.<br><br>
                This trip is perfect. We were able to make a lot of memories. Even though they are formed by our own twisted sense of humor and by monkeying around, those memories are something I will forever cherish.</p>

            <p>Despite being separated into different rows on our commercial flight, we found creative ways to entertain ourselves. We passed notes and jokes around back and forth, occasionally erupting into fits of laughter that drew curious glances from nearby passengers.<br><br> 
            I brought a Nintendo Switch and then played an engaging game of Brawhalla with Murray behind me. Another had downloaded a multiplayer game on their phones and they challenged each other to a friendly competition. </p>

        <div class="lateNightSupperPt1">
            <p>After a long flight to Malaysia, the gamer Unite was famished and eager to try the local cuisine. We headed straight to a nearby 7/11 to buy snacks. I bought a Kimchi Sushi rolls and it was okay, but that is not what I was excited about.After taking a long cab ride to our accomodation, we change into comfortable cloths and rushes toward the "GOATED" food stall to ordered our first ever JESUS ROTI CANAI, or at least from what our Malaysian group of friends call it.</p>

            <p>As we watched the chef expertly stretch and flip the dough, our Malaysian group of friends came to visit us. We had a blast in messing around and catching up with one another. Infact, this is my first time meeting my Malaysian friends physically and it is refreshing to meet old friends face-to-face. When the dish arrived, we eagerly tore into the crispy, buttery layers and dipped it into the flavorful curry sauce. It was a revelatory experience. Laughing and joking as we enjoyed our midnight snack, we knew that this was only the beginning of our journey in Malaysia.

            <p>As the night fell, the big group of friends decided to chill in our accomodation. Excitement filled the air as they shared stories and laughter while sipping on Soju. The room echoed with playful banter and inside jokes, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. It was a perfect moment for us to bond over shared memories and create new ones.<br><br>
                Infact, since some of us wanted to take a stroll in nearby area, our explorative nature had allowed us to spot a "ghost"! Here is the footage that we recovered.

            <p>On the 19th of September, we were eager to explore Kuala Lumpur and all it had to offer. But before setting out, we decided to fuel up with a hearty breakfast with Murray's parents.<br><br>
                As they savored each bite of Roti Prata, Murray's parents shared stories about their life in KL and gave tips on the best places to visit. The group felt energized and ready to take on the city after such a warm and delicious start to the day.<br><br>
                One of the highlights of our trip was visiting the Petronas Twin Towers, which offered stunning views of the city skyline.

            <p>After a long day of exploring the bustling city of Kuala Lumpur, We were EXHAUSTED. The Gamer Unite had spent hours visiting the iconic Petronas Towers, strolling through the vibrant Central Market, and indulging in delicious local street food.<br><br> As we made their way back to their accomodation, our feet ached and eyes were heavy with fatigue. But despite that, we couldn't help but feel a sense of exhilaration and gratitude for the unforgettable experiences we had shared together in this beautiful and exciting city.

            </div>
            <p>This trip also allows us to experience a different culture. Even though Singapore and Malaysia are quite close to one another, we can really see the differences in cultures through their cooking’s spices and slang.<br><br>
                For example, when I order a cup of water in Malaysia, I have to say “Ice Kosong”. “Ice” is meant “chilled/iced drink” in this context, while “Kosong” is a slang for “no sugar”. So when we order “Iced Kosong”, we are technically ordering ice cubes.<br><br>
                As we said our goodbyes to Kuala Lumpur, we knew that we had experienced something truly special. Our trip had brought us closer together as friends, and we left Malaysia with a deeper appreciation for its culture, its people, and its place in the world.
